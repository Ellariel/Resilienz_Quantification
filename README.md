In power system engineering the concept of resilience has critical importance because a resiliently designed system can save lives, reduce costs, and mitigate the overall negative impact of shocks. This paper addresses the quantification of resilience 
through a holistic approach that includes both the network topology and properties that contribute to strengthening resilience and flexibility or reducing vulnerability. A metric for resilience quantification has been developed, encompassing system 
properties such as diversity, connectivity, subsidiarity, redundancy, and storage capabilities. The proposed resilience assessment method is tested on various electricity networks.
